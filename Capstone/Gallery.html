        <p id="title3">The preferences on the final design are based on the proposed alternative designs whether 
            Alternative Design no. 1: modification of a component, Alternative Design no. 2: additional component, or 
            Alternative Design no. 3: component replacement.
            Considering the results of the pairwise comparison and trade-off strategy, alternative design no. 3 is 
            the most suitable and efficient which also fits the codes and standards provided. The concluding design is 
            the modification of Kiln system by replacing the NCC old burner by FLSmidth Jetflex burner that provides: 
            (1) High net calorific values of 10-20 Mj/kg; (2) Emits less CO₂ and with high burning capacity and ability to 
            use alternative fuel, sewage sludge will be used as alternative fuel in clinker manufacture due to treatment 
            of minimizing water content resulting in a low- to medium-energy dry solid fuel. The design is able to produce 
            increase annual production through resisting the interruption of possible disaster by providing the following:</p>
            <ol id="title3"> <strong>Increases fuel retention time:</strong> JetFlex pulls the solid alternative fuels (AF) pipes into the burner. The solid AF particles are 
                halted and then accelerated again once the center pipes are retracted by up to 200mm</ol>
            <ol id="title3"> <strong>Improves plant production:</strong> Uncomplex manipulation of the primary air pressure and flow may readily control the kiln 
                burner flame shape or velocity</ol>
            <ol id="title3"> <strong>Safe and Eco-friendly process:</strong> Less CO₂ emission process</ol>
            <ol id="title3"> <strong>Resource management:</strong> Fuel consumption are reduced by low fuel consumption of FLSmidth Jetflex burner and 
                having solid-fuel alternatives from heat-treated sewage sludge</ol>

        <p id="title3">Basis: Final design is based on average wind speed available over wind speed for optimum power production which is reported to be only 40.26%.
            Objective: Goal of Final Design is to lower the optimum wind speed to maximize the average wind speed available.
            Operation: Designing a high lift system for the existing wind turbine blade of Vestas V90-1.8MW</p>
